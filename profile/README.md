PENTA is a "Music Adventure Game" in which the game progresses through <b>music playback</b>.<br>
You can discover the PENTA STONE by listening to music and grow your own headphones. You can also buy and sell headphones and PENTA STONE. Adding game elements to a traditional music player like Spotify creates a more uplifting experience of music discovery.
